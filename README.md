## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

A modern web browser is required. A code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for customization.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
    * For the best local development experience, it is recommended to use a simple local server. The [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code is an excellent option.

## üé® Customization

This portfolio is designed to be easily personalized. To use this project as a template, follow this guide to modify the content.

### 1. Connecting the Contact Form (Formspree)

To receive messages from the contact form, it must be connected to a Formspree endpoint.

1.  Create a free account at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/).
2.  Create a "New Form" to receive a unique endpoint URL.
3.  Open **`index.html`** and locate the `<form>` tag within `<section id="contact">`.
4.  Replace the placeholder `action` URL with your unique Formspree endpoint URL.

    ```html
    <form class="space-y-6" ... action="[https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID](https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID)" method="POST">
    ```

### 2. Text Content (Bio, Experience, Projects)

All professional information, such as the biography, resume details, and project descriptions, is located directly in **`index.html`**. Edit the text within the relevant sections to update the content.

### 3. Images and Resume PDF

All static assets are located in the `/assets/` directory.

* **Profile Photo**: Replace `profile-photo.jpg` in `/assets/images/`.
* **Project Images**: Replace `project-1.jpg`, `project-2.jpg`, etc., in `/assets/images/`.
* **Resume PDF**: Place your resume file in the `/assets/` directory and ensure the link in the "Download Full Resume" button points to the correct filename.

### 4. Skills Section

The skills section is located in **`index.html`**. Each skill is a `<div>` block that can be added, removed, or modified.

* Logos are sourced from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). To add or change a logo, construct a new URL using the format: `https://cdn.simpleicons.org/BRANDNAME/HEXCOLOR`.

### 5. Chatbot Knowledge Base

The chatbot's responses are controlled by the `knowledgeBase` object in **`main.js`**.

* Locate the `initializeChatbot` function.
* Modify the string values within the `knowledgeBase` object to update the chatbot's knowledge with your professional details.

    ```javascript
    const knowledgeBase = {
        'default': "I am unable to answer that question at this time. Please ask about skills or experience.",
        'greeting': "Hello. How can I provide information about [Your Name]?",
        'experience': "[Your detailed experience summary here...]",
        'skills': "[Your skills summary here...]",
        // ... etc.
    };
    ```
